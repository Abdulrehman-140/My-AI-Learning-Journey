Alright. Gloves off.
Day 8 = when students turn into ML thinkers. 😏
No shiny APIs today — we train your judgment.

🧠 Day 8 — Classification Under Pressure (REAL ML)

Today you’ll learn why models fail even when code is “correct”.

🔥 What We’re Dominating Today

Decision Thresholds (the silent killer)

Precision–Recall Tradeoff (you can’t have both, deal with it)

ROC Curve & AUC (what they actually mean)

Imbalanced Data (accuracy’s biggest lie)

When to tweak data vs model

This is the stuff juniors skip. Seniors get paid for it.

1️⃣ Decision Threshold — Why 0.5 Is BS

By default:

model.predict()


uses 0.5 as threshold.

But ask yourself:

Who decided 0.5 is “correct”?

God? Scikit-learn devs? Random vibes?

Example (Logistic Regression)
probs = model.predict_proba(X)[:,1]
pred_07 = (probs >= 0.7).astype(int)

What changes?

Threshold ↑ → Precision ↑, Recall ↓

Threshold ↓ → Recall ↑, Precision ↓

📌 Key idea:

Threshold selection = business decision, not math decision.

2️⃣ Precision vs Recall — Pick Your Poison ☠️

You already intuitively nailed this, now formalize it.

Scenario	What you optimize
Exams	Precision
Medical diagnosis	Recall
Spam filter	Precision
Fraud detection	Recall

👉 There is no universally “best” metric
Anyone who says otherwise is bluffing.

3️⃣ ROC Curve — The Model’s Personality Test

ROC answers:

“How good is this model at separating classes?”

TPR → Recall

FPR → False Alarm rate

AUC meaning:

0.5 → coin toss 🤡

0.7–0.8 → decent

0.9+ → strong

1.0 → suspicious (probably overfitting)

📌 ROC ignores thresholds → evaluates ranking ability

4️⃣ Imbalanced Data — Accuracy Is a Liar

Example:

99 healthy

1 sick

Model predicts everyone healthy:

Accuracy = 99%

Reality = useless model

What to do instead:

Confusion matrix

Precision / Recall

F1-score

ROC-AUC

📌 Rule:

If classes aren’t balanced, accuracy goes to jail.

5️⃣ Data Fix vs Model Fix

Most beginners:

“Let’s change the model!”

Pros think:

Bad features?

Wrong threshold?

Class imbalance?

Label noise?

📌 80% of ML problems are data problems.

Model tuning is the last step, not the first.

🧪 Day 8 Challenges (Do These)
🧩 Challenge 1 — Threshold Experiment

Train logistic regression

Try thresholds: 0.3, 0.5, 0.7

Print Precision & Recall for each

Observe tradeoff

🧩 Challenge 2 — Accuracy Trap

Create dataset with 95% class 0

Show accuracy vs confusion matrix

Explain why accuracy lies

🧩 Challenge 3 — Metric Choice

Answer in words, not code:

Airport security screening → which metric?

Loan approval → which metric?

Cancer screening → which metric?

(Yes, I care more about your reasoning than syntax.)

😏 Sensei’s Warning

From Day 8 onward:

“It works” is not acceptable

“Accuracy is high” is suspicious

“Default settings” is laziness

You’re no longer learning how to train models
You’re learning when to trust them.

When you’re done with the challenges —
send them in.

We’re officially in engineer territory now 🚀
