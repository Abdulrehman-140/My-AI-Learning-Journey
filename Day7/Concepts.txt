🧠 Day 7 — Classification Mastery (The Real World Edition)

1️Why Accuracy Lies (Yes, It Lies Straight to Your Face)

Imagine: 95 emails and 90 are not spam, 5 are spam
A dumb model says “Not Spam” for everything.
Accuracy?
90 / 95 = 94.7%
Looks amazing.
Catches 0 spam.
Congrats, your inbox is ruined.
This is why accuracy alone is useless in many cases.

2️Confusion Matrix (Your Truth Table)
[[TN  FP]
 [FN  TP]]


Let’s decode it like a human:

TP → Correct YES

TN → Correct NO

FP → False alarm 

FN → Missed disaster 

In medical or fraud cases:

FN is worse than FP
Missed disease > false warning

Precision — “When I say YES, how often am I right?”

Formula:

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)


Example:

Model predicted PASS = 10 students

Actually passed = 6

Precision = 6 / 10 = 60%

Used when false alarms are expensive

Spam filters

Law enforcement

AI moderation

Recall — “Did I catch all the YES cases?”

Formula:

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)


Example:

10 people truly sick

Model detected 7

Recall = 70%

Used when missing a case is deadly

Cancer detection

Fraud detection

Intrusion detection

Precision vs Recall (Choose Your Poison)

You cannot maximize both.

High precision → strict model

High recall → generous model

Real life always chooses based on consequences, not ego.

F1-Score — The Peace Treaty

Formula:

F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)


Used when: Dataset is imbalanced and Accuracy is misleading

You want balance, not drama
You already met:

Sigmoid → binary (0 or 1)

Softmax is just:

Sigmoid’s big brother for multiple classes

Example:

[2.1, 1.3, 0.2] → softmax → [0.65, 0.25, 0.10]


Probabilities add up to 1.
That’s it. No magic. No fear.

from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

print("Precision:", precision_score(Pass, pred))
print("Recall:", recall_score(Pass, pred))
print("F1:", f1_score(Pass, pred))

In exam prediction, what’s worse?

False Pass

False Fail

In disease detection, what’s worse?

False Positive

False Negative

No math. Just logic.
